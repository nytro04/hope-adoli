          Meet GrainMate app: A companion of GrainMate moisture meter. While the
          moisture meter is used to measure the moisture content in grains, the
          app uses the result to suggest a solution. But thatâ€™s not all. The
          appâ€™s Learn feature curates mini lessons on Post Harvest Loss (PHL)
          and how to prevent/manage it. It also has a marketplace for
          agribusinesses to sell agricultural products.

          The challenge
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-5 text-gray-400">
          Sesi Technologiesâ€™ primary target is to use technology to help reduce
          the alarming occurrence of Post Harvest Loss (PHL) being witnessed by
          grain farmers across Africa, especially Ghana.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-gray-400">
          As of December 2019, it was estimated that
          <span class="font-semibold text-white">
            Ghana losses close to USD 141 million in cereals due to PHLðŸ˜±.
          </span>
          So in order to achieve the goal of minimising the occurrence of same,
          they came up with a moisture meter for farmers to use, called
          GrainMate Moisture Meter.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 ">
          After about 2 years of exposing these local farmers to the GrainMate
          Moisture Moisture Moisture Meter and after receiving several feedbacks
          from them, there became a need to have a companion mobile app. The
          team reached out to me to design the mobile app.

        <p class="text-gray-400 lg:w-6/12">
          From our UX research of the 4 main target users, it became evident
          that the farmers were going to need the most help navigating the app.
          app. order to help them do so easily, I used colours on the
          backgrounds of of each tool to serve as a differentiator. Each tool
          was represented by a title, description and an illustration. Also, the
          tool that will used by them was placed in front.

        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 lg:w-6/12">
          One of the most exciting things about this project was unlearning most
          things I knew about farming and agriculture as a whole, and then
          learning new behaviours from farmers, warehouse managers,
          agribusinesses, agri enthusiasts and learners among others. The
          uniqueness of this project lies in the target user base: a group of
          users with very varying levels of understanding when it comes to the
          use of technology.
