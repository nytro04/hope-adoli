          Meet GrainMate app: A companion of GrainMate moisture meter. While the
          moisture meter is used to measure the moisture content in grains, the
          app uses the result to suggest a solution. But thatâ€™s not all. The
          appâ€™s Learn feature curates mini lessons on Post Harvest Loss (PHL)
          and how to prevent/manage it. It also has a marketplace for
          agribusinesses to sell agricultural products.

        The challenge
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-5 text-gray-400">
        Sesi Technologiesâ€™ primary target is to use technology to help reduce
        the alarming occurrence of Post Harvest Loss (PHL) being witnessed by
        grain farmers across Africa, especially Ghana.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 text-gray-400">
        As of December 2019, it was estimated that
        <span class="font-semibold text-white">
          Ghana losses close to USD 141 million in cereals due to PHLðŸ˜±.
        </span>
        So in order to achieve the goal of minimising the occurrence of same,
        they came up with a moisture meter for farmers to use, called GrainMate
        Moisture Meter.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 ">
        After about 2 years of exposing these local farmers to the GrainMate
        Moisture Moisture Moisture Meter and after receiving several feedbacks
        from them, there became a need to have a companion mobile app. The team
        reached out to me to design the mobile app.

        A beautiful design that solves problems.
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 lg:w-6/12">
        From our UX research of the 4 main target users, it became evident that
        the farmers were going to need the most help navigating the app. In
        order to help them do so easily, I used colours on the backgrounds of
        each tool to serve as a differentiator. Each tool was represented by a
        title, description and an illustration. Also, the tool that will used by
        them was placed in front.

        Designing for 10,000+ unique set of target user base.
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 lg:w-6/12">
        One of the most exciting things about this project was unlearning most
        things I knew about farming and agriculture as a whole, and then
        learning new behaviours from farmers, warehouse managers,
        agribusinesses, agri enthusiasts and learners among others. The
        uniqueness of this project lies in the target user base: a group of
        users with very varying levels of understanding when it comes to the use
        of technology.
